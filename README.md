# 🌊Wavelength🌊

👋 **Intro:**
- This project is a web application version of the popular TikTok card game "Wavelength". I don't own or claim to own any rights to this game, I just didn't want to buy the game and wait for shipping. It should work on both desktop and mobile. If you have any issues please email me or message me on LinkedIn!

📦 **Tech Stack:**
- React.js
- Firebase (DB and hosting)
- HTML/CSS

👩🏽‍🍳 **Features:**
- Randomly draw a card from the deck and display it.
- When the deck runs out of cards, it resets.
- Option to cover/uncover the spinner circle (is there a better name for this?).
- View the entire deck of cards in a table format.
- View my wonderful FAQ page.

💭 **Process:**
- The project started with setting up the React environment and integrating Firebase Realtime Database for data storage.
- Designing and implementing the card management features followed, including adding, viewing, and removing cards.
- The random card drawing functionality was added next, with consideration for covering and uncovering the drawn card.
- I then went into drawing the game with the help of Notability, an iPad, and an Apple Pencil.
- I removed the background from these images, stacked them on top of each other, and added the proper functionality to some of the images (i.e. hiding or unhiding the cover, spinning the spinner, randomizing the "triangle" portion).
- I then finished it off with some final CSS touches to ensure it looks good on all devices.

📚 **What I learned:**
- This project was my first dive into using Firebase for real-time database management. 
- I learned how to set up Firebase with React and integrate it seamlessly into the application for storing and retrieving data. 
- Through this experience, I gained insight into Firebase's capabilities and its advantages in building dynamic web applications. 
- Additionally, as I'm still relatively new to React, this project provided valuable practice in React development, reinforcing concepts such as component structure, state management, and lifecycle methods. 
- Overall, the combination of Firebase and React offered a powerful toolkit for creating interactive and responsive web applications, and I look forward to further exploring and mastering these technologies in future projects.

✨ **Improvements:**
- Enhance the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.
- Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own decks.
- Possibly make it online 1v1 style (?)

🚦 **Running the Project:**
To run the project locally:
- Clone the repository from GitHub.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.
- Add your own Firebase DB: you can replace my constants with your information.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.
